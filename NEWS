This file contains a summary of important user-visible changes.

Changes since 1.0
=================

* tuple and record support in the compatibility library
* user patterns are now supported in the SMT-LIBv1.2 parser
* SMT-LIB get-model output now is easier to machine-parse: contains (model...)
* Win32 support via mingw
* for printing commands as they're invoked from the driver, you now need
  verbosity of 3 or higher (e.g. -vvv) instead of verbosity 1 or higher (-v).
  This allows tracing the solver's activities without having too much output.
* multiline support in interactive mode
* To make CVC4 quieter in abnormal (e.g., "warning" conditions), you can
  use -q.  Previously, this would silence all output (including "sat" or
  "unsat") as well.  Now, single -q silences messages and warnings, and
  double -qq silences all output (except on exception or signal).
* Boolean term support in datatypes
